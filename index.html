                <li>Did you know that Einstein wrote his first essay on theoretical physics at the age of 16, which he titled “on the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field.”?</li>
                <li>Albert Einstein never learned to swim. However, he loved sailing and continued to do so as a hobby throughout his life. Also, Einstein never wore socks. He thought wearing socks was a pain, and he would often get holes in them.</li>
                <li>Amazingly, Einstein also co-invented a refrigerator that would work on compressed gases. Einstein is also considered to be the man behind the inventions such as – the photoelectric cells, lasers, nuclear power, and fiber optics and even semiconductors.</li>
                <li>Einstein became one of the most famous faces on the planet when his prediction that gravity bends light was confirmed during an eclipse in 1919.</li>
                <li> Einstein was very fond of music, and his mother played a vital role in his inclination towards music. She played the violin, which became a source of enjoyment and inspiration for the young Einstein, who himself learned to play the instrument at the tender age of five. He said, “If I were not a scientist, I would be a musician.”</li>
                <li>Did you know that almost immediately after Albert Einstein learned of the atomic bomb’s use in Japan, he became an advocate for nuclear disarmament?</li>
                <li>Just after Einstein died in 1955, the recently discovered element with atomic number 99 was given the name ‘einsteinium’ in his honor.</li>
                <li>Albert Einstein was a genius theoretical physicist. He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence, theory of relativity, Brownian motion and photoelectric effect. He was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</li>
                <li>Einstein was slow to talk. Some say he didn’t start speaking until age four. Stanford economist Dr. Thomas Sowell even coined the controversial term “Einstein Syndrome“ to describe exceptionally bright people whose speech is delayed.</li>
                <li>Einstein died on April 18, 1955 after suffering a burst blood vessel. According to the website of the American Museum of Natural History, doctors suggested surgery, but Einstein declined, saying, “It is tasteless to prolong life artificially.”</li>
